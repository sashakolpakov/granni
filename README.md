# Grassmannians for Nearest Neighbor Identification (GraNNI)

Michael Werman (HUJI, Israel), Alexander Kolpakov (University of Neuchatel, Switzerland)

A new algorithm, GraNNI (Grassmannians for Nearest Neighbours Identification) to solve the problem of affine registration is proposed. The algorithm is based on the Grassmannian of $k$-dimensional planes in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and minimizing the Frobenius norm between the two elements of the Grassmannian. The results of the experiments show that the algorithm is more robust to noise and point discrepancy in point clouds than  previous approaches. Our main comparison is with GrassGraph that appears to be state-of-the-art [IEEE Trans. Image Proc., vol. 29, pp. 3374-3387, 2020, doi: 10.1109/TIP.2019.2959722].
